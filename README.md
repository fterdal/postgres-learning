# Playing with Postgres

1. Trying out [this extension](https://github.com/Borvik/vscode-postgres) first. Seems quite neat to be able to query a connection from within VSCode, and get some intellisense. For instance, it'll let me know if I've misspelled a table name or misused a column type before running the query. I can also save db connections and come back to them later. Each file has to have the .pgsql extension, and the results appear (by default) in a separate table-pane on the right.


2. Oh wow, [this extension](https://vscode-sqltools.mteixeira.dev/) is so much better. Really nice tab-completion and schema hints. The table results can easily be filtered and saved as either CSV or JSON.

3. Oooooh, and take a look at [this package](https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise), that simplifies working with the pg module in a node application.
